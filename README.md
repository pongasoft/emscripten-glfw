Introduction
------------

This project is an Emscripten port of GLFW written in C++ for the web/wasm platform. The currently supported
GLFW API is 3.4.

Goal
----

The main goal of this project is to implement as much of the GLFW API that is possible to implement
in the context of a web browser.

Since this project is targeting the web/webassembly platform, which runs in more recent web browsers, it is also trying
to focus on using the most recent features and not use deprecated features (for example, uses `keyboardEvent.key` 
vs `keyboardEvent.charcode`). As a result, this implementation will most likely not work in older browsers.

Since the code is written in C++, it is trying to minimize the amount of JavaScript code to remain clean and lean.

Features
--------

Main features:
* can create as many windows as you want, each one associated to a different canvas (use 
  `emscripten::glfw3::SetNextWindowCanvasSelector("#canvas2")` to specify which canvas to use)
* resizable window/canvas (use `emscripten::glfw3::MakeCanvasResizable(...)` to make the canvas resizable by user.
  Use `"window"` as the resize selector for full frame canvas (ex: ImGui))
* mouse (includes sticky button behavior) & touch
* keyboard (includes sticky key behavior and Meta key workaround)
* joystick/gamepad
* fullscreen
* Hi DPI 
* all GLFW cursors and custom cursors
* window opacity
* size constraints (size limits and aspect ratio)
* visibility
* focus
* clipboard (cut/copy/paste with external clipboard)
* timer
* pthread

Demo
----

<a href="https://pongasoft.github.io/emscripten-glfw/test/demo/main.html">![emscripten_glfw](https://github.com/pongasoft/emscripten-glfw/releases/download/v3.4.0.20240817/emscripten-glfw.png)</a>

Check out the [live demo](https://pongasoft.github.io/emscripten-glfw/test/demo/main.html) of the example code. Note that you
need to use a "modern" browser to see it in action. Currently tested on Google Chrome 120+ and Firefox 121+. 

The [code](test/demo/src) for the demo is included in this project.

The demo shows 2 canvases each created via a `glfwCreateWindow` and shows how they respond to keyboard and mouse events
(using direct apis, like `glfwGetMouseButton` or callback apis like `glfwSetMouseButtonCallback`)

- canvas1 is hi dpi aware (`glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SCALE_FRAMEBUFFER, GLFW_TRUE)`)
- canvas2 is **not** hi dpi aware (but can be made so with the "Enable" Hi DPI Aware button)
- canvas2 is fully resizable (use the square handle to resize) (`emscripten::glfw3::MakeCanvasResizable(window2, "#canvas2-container", "#canvas2-handle")`)

You can enable/disable each window/canvas independently:

- When 2 (or more) canvases are present, the canvas that has focus can receive keyboard events. If no other element on 
  the page has focus, then the last canvas that had the focus will receive these events. Clicking with the left mouse 
  button on a canvas gives it focus.
- When there is only 1 canvas, the implementation tries to be smart about it and will route keyboard (and other relevant) 
  events to the single canvas if nothing else has focus (the 'Change focus/Text' field is used to test 
  this feature since clicking on the text field grabs the focus).

The demo uses webgl to render a triangle (the hellow world of gpu rendering...).

Integration
-----------

Since ImGui [v1.91.0](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.91.0),
ImGui can be configured to use this port, allowing full gamepad and clipboard support amongst many other advantages. 

Quick start (Emscripten port)
-----------------------------

Since Emscripten 3.1.55, using this library is really easy via the Emscripten `use-port` option:
`--use-port=contrib.glfw3` (no need to clone this repo at all!).
This is the recommended method to use this project.

### Command line

Example:

```sh
emcc --use-port=contrib.glfw3 main.cpp -o build/index.html
```

### CMake

With CMake, you need to provide the option both for compile and link phases:

```cmake
target_compile_options(${target} PUBLIC "--use-port=contrib.glfw3")
target_link_options(${target} PUBLIC "--use-port=contrib.glfw3")
```

### Makefile

This is an example from ImGui (`examples/example_emscripten_wgpu`)

```Makefile
EMS += -s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=1 --use-port=contrib.glfw3
#LDFLAGS += -s USE_GLFW=3 -s USE_WEBGPU=1
LDFLAGS += -s USE_WEBGPU=1
```

Port Options
------------

The port can be configured with the following options:

| Option               | Description                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `disableJoystick`    | Boolean to disable support for joystick entirely, which can be useful if you don't need it due to polling |
| `disableWarning`     | Boolean to disable warnings emitted by the library (for example when using non supported features)        |
| `disableMultiWindow` | Boolean to disable multi window support which makes the code smaller and faster if you don't need it      |
| `disableWebGL2`      | Boolean to disable support for WebGL2 (which makes the code smaller) if you don't need it                 |

Example using `disableWarning` and `disableMultiWindow`:

```sh
emcc --use-port=contrib.glfw3:disableWarning=true:disableMultiWindow=true main.cpp -o build
```

#### 3.4.0.20241004 - 2024-10-04 | Emscripten 3.1.69

- Implemented custom cursors (`glfwCreateCursor`)
  - uses a canvas to draw the cursor image into it and convert it into a URL (`canvas.toDataURL()`)
  - uses the CSS property syntax: `cursor: url(xxx) xhot yhot, auto` when calling `glfwSetCursor` with a custom cursor

#### 3.4.0.20240907 - 2024-09-07 | Emscripten 3.1.66

- Fixed Meta/Super key workaround to also handle the rare (but possible) use-case of having other keys down before
  pressing the Meta/Super key

#### 3.4.0.20240817 - 2024-08-17 | Emscripten 3.1.65

  mostly used for keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl vs. Cmd). 
- Added `GLFW/emscripten_glfw3_version.h` with `EMSCRIPTEN_GLFW_VERSION` define for compilation time version detection
- `EMSCRIPTEN_USE_PORT_CONTRIB_GLFW3` port define now also contains the version
 
> [!WARNING]
> Breaking changes!
> The clipboard async API has been removed.
> Note that due to emscripten release cadence, these changes were never part of the emscripten port,
> so it is unlikely going to affect your project.
> Check the [Clipboard support](docs/Usage.md#clipboard-support) section for details on how to deal with the 
> clipboard in your application.

#### 3.4.0.20240804 - 2024-08-04 | Emscripten 3.1.65

- Fixed `nullptr` issue when clipboard is empty
- Fixed the internal clipboard being wiped on asynchronous callback error

#### 3.4.0.20240731 - 2024-07-31 | Emscripten 3.1.65

- Added `emscripten_glfw_get_clipboard_string` the C version of  `emscripten::glfw3::GetClipboardString` to
  retrieve the clipboard asynchronously
- Added a helper class `emscripten::glfw3::FutureClipboardString` to greatly simplify the more frequent use-cases
- `GetClipboardString::value()` now returns the internal clipboard in case of error, instead of throwing exception
- Added `optimizationLevel` option to the emscripten port

#### 3.4.0.20240727 - 2024-07-27 | Emscripten 3.1.65

- Introduced C++ API (namespace `emscripten::glfw3`) included with `GLFW3/emscripten_glfw3.h`:
  - provides a more correct API with sensible defaults (ex: `std::string_view` / `std::optional<std::string_view>` 
    vs `char const *` which may or may not be `nullptr`)
  - allow for C++ only API (ex: `std::future`)
  - the C API is still available if you would rather stick to it
- Implemented  `emscripten::glfw3::GetClipboardString` which provides a way of fetching the global
  clipboard in a browser environment (`glfwGetClipboardString` is not the right API due to the asynchronous nature 
  of the underlying platform API).
- The cursor position is no longer clamped to the window size, and as a result, can have negative values or values
  greater than the window size.
  Note that GLFW implements a similar behavior on the macOS desktop platform.
- Implemented `glfwSetWindowPosCallback`
- Added support for GLFW Window Attribute `GLFW_HOVERED`
- Fixed [#6](https://github.com/pongasoft/emscripten-glfw/issues/6): _`emscripten_glfw_make_canvas_resizable` does not clean up properly_.
- Fixed an issue with opacity: when using opacity, the handle is not working unless its z-index is higher than the 
  canvas z-index

#### 3.4.0.20240627 - 2024-06-27 | Emscripten 3.1.63

- Fixed internal implementation to use `EM_BOOL` (PR [#5](https://github.com/pongasoft/emscripten-glfw/pull/5))

#### 3.4.0.20240625 - 2024-06-25 | Emscripten 3.1.63

- Implemented workaround for [#4](https://github.com/pongasoft/emscripten-glfw/issues/4): _Using Super + "Key" on macOS results in "Key" not being released_.
  Due to the [broken state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11818637/why-does-javascript-drop-keyup-events-when-the-metakey-is-pressed-on-mac-browser) of 
  JavaScript handling the `Super/Meta` key, there is no good solution.
  The workaround implemented, releases all keys when `Super` is released.
  Although not a perfect solution, it guarantees that the state is _eventually_ consistent:
    - if "Key" was released while "Super" was held, then when "Super" gets released, "Key" is released 
      (later than when actually released, final state is consistent: "Key" in `Release` state)
    - if "Key" is still held when "Super" is released, "Key" is released when "Super" gets released, 
      but immediately gets a down event (Up/Down event, final state is consistent": "Key" in `Pressed` state)

#### 3.4.0.20240617 - 2024-06-17 | Emscripten 3.1.63

- Fixed [#3](https://github.com/pongasoft/emscripten-glfw/issues/3): _glfwGetKey must return one of `GLFW_PRESS` or `GLFW_RELEASE`_

#### 3.4.0.20240616 - 2024-06-16 | Emscripten 3.1.63

- Implemented `glfwGetClipboardString`. Note that due to the async (and restrictive) nature of the 
  `navigator.clipboard.readText` call, this synchronous API returns whatever was set via a previous call
  to `glfwSetClipboardString` and ignores the external clipboard entirely.

#### 3.4.0.20240601 - 2024-06-01 | Emscripten 3.1.63

- Fixed [#2](https://github.com/pongasoft/emscripten-glfw/issues/2): Dynamically changing HiDPI awareness does not trigger content callback

#### 3.4.0.20240514 - 2024-05-14 | Emscripten 3.1.60

- Implemented `glfwSetClipboardString`

#### 3.4.0.20240501 - 2024-05-01 | Emscripten 3.1.60

- Fixed issue when calling `glfwGetWindowContentScale` with `nullptr`
- Renamed javascript api/impl since these names are not unique to avoid potential conflicts
- Added `glfw3native.h` to `GLFW`. Although not used (at this moment) by this implementation, this allows
  calling code to include it if necessary since it is part of a normal GLFW installation.

#### 3.4.0.20240318 - 2024-03-18 | Emscripten 3.1.57

- Fixed joystick/gamepad code that was improperly mapping `GLFW_GAMEPAD_AXIS_LEFT_TRIGGER`
  `GLFW_GAMEPAD_AXIS_RIGHT_TRIGGER`, `GLFW_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LEFT_THUMB` and `GLFW_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_RIGHT_THUMB`
- `GLFW_GAMEPAD_AXIS_LEFT_TRIGGER` and `GLFW_GAMEPAD_AXIS_RIGHT_TRIGGER` are now properly represented as an analog
  value in the range [-1.0, +1.0]
- Please note the change in version numbering, which from now on will be tied to the GLFW version implemented + date
  of release of this port to avoid confusion

#### 1.1.0 - 2024-02-29 | Emscripten 3.1.56

- Upgraded to GLFW 3.4
- GLFW 3.4 features implemented
  - `glfwGetPlatform` and `glfwPlatformSupported` uses the `GLFW_PLATFORM_EMSCRIPTEN` constant defined in 
    `emscripten-glfw3.h` (officially reserved value is `0x00060006`)
  - `glfwInitHint` supports the new hint `GLFW_PLATFORM`
  - Supports all 10 cursors
  - Implemented `glfwGetWindowTitle`
  - Use `GLFW_SCALE_FRAMEBUFFER` to enable (resp. disable) Hi DPI support
  - Changed the functions that can report `GLFW_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE` failure to report this error instead of a warning
- GLFW 3.4 features not implemented
  - `GLFW_MOUSE_PASSTHROUGH` is not supported
  - `GLFW_CURSOR_CAPTURED` cursor input mode is not supported (not possible in a browser context)
  - `glfwInitAllocator` is implemented as noop (could be supported for the C++ part only if there is demand, not javascript)
  - `GLFW_POSITION_X` and `GLFW_POSITION_Y` are not supported (same as `glfwSetWindowPos`)
  - `GLFW_ANGLE_PLATFORM_TYPE` is not supported (no direct access in browser, but implementation is most likely using it anyway) 
- Since GLFW 3.4 introduces a proper constant to handle Hi DPI Awareness (`GLFW_SCALE_FRAMEBUFFER`), the prior
  constant used by this port (`GLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR`) is still accepted, but it is now deprecated. In addition,
  due to the fact that `GLFW_SCALE_FRAMEBUFFER` defaults to `GLFW_TRUE`, this port is now Hi DPI aware by default and
  needs to be explicitly turned off (`glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SCALE_FRAMEBUFFER, GLFW_FALSE)`) if this is the desired
  behavior.
